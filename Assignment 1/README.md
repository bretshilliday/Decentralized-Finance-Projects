For A1 FNCE 55909

For this project we chose to take a look at the position NFTs created when liquidity is provided by Uniswap V3. Different from an LP token, an NFT represents a specific position in the pool with upper and lower limits to the liquidity provided as well as the quantity. We chose to see how users were trading these positions.
